							<label>aquaponics basin</label>
							<description>A deep water filled basin capable of processing vegetable matter into an algae-like paste for continuous feeding of fish living within. Fish within live in optimal water conditions and temperature and therefore breed quite quickly. Matured fish will occasionally be deposited to a nearby output hopper.\n\n&lt;color=#33d733&gt;Automation Chain:&lt;/color&gt; The Aquaponics basin is not part of any automation chain, it is an independent building.</description>
