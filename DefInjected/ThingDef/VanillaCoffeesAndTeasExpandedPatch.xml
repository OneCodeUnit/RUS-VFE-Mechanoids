							<description>An industrial-sized oven that deeply roasts coffee beans before dispensing them to a quern that grinds them into grounds. Boiling water is then forced and filtered through the grounds into a mass amount of coffee. Nearby hoppers can also hold other products for processing a number of coffee-related drinks.\n\n&lt;color=#33d733&gt;Automation Chain:&lt;/color&gt; The Industrial Coffee Roaster is not part of any automation chain, it is an independent building.</description>
