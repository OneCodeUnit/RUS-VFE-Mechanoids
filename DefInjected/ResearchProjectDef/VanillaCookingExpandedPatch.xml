							<description>Research a tank capable of rapidly heating milk until curds begin to form, then automatically straining and pressing them into multiple wheels of cheese at once. Nearby hoppers can hold enough milk to make several wheels and finished wheels will automatically be dispensed.</description>

							<description>Research a very large vat with a series of mounted, spinning blades towards the top. Attached hoppers can be filled with a variety of raw food products. Thereafter they are vacuumed through the top, sliced and simmered deeply into a variety of soups. Finished soups will be dispensed to an opposing hopper without the need of processing steps. Input and output both are done en masse and require much less management than traditional slow cooking.</description>
